# Follow Me 2D
{: .no_toc }
Project 1 Checkpoint - WARNING: THIS MATERIAL IS UNRELEASED AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE!
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Instructions

In this checkpoint you will implement two functions for finding the minimum value in a vector. The first will be a basic implementation and the second will ignore values of zero so that it can be used with the Lidar, which returns values of zero on bad readings. You will then implement follow me 2D by repeatedly finding the minimum value of the current Lidar scan, and then applying either bang-bang control or p-control to maintain a setpoint distance from the obstacle in the direction of the shortest Lidar scan. Complete the following:

- Implement ```findMinDist()``` in ```mbot_lib/mbot_lib/utils.cpp``` according to the header file ```mbot_lib/mbot_lib/utils.h```.
- Implement ```findMinNonzeroDist()``` in ```mbot_lib/mbot_lib/utils.cpp``` according to the header file ```mbot_lib/mbot_lib/utils.h```.
- Implement follow me 2D in ```4_follow_2d.cpp``` so that the robot performs the behavior specified below.

Feel free to look back at how you implemented follow me 1D.

- *Hint: Remember to use the appropriate function for finding the minimum distance in a real Lidar scan.*
- *Hint: Driving in polar coordinates should look familiar.*

## Testing and Expected Behavior

The functions can be tested by running the local unit tests. To test only the functions for this checkpoint run ```ctest -R FindMinDist && ctest -R FindMinNonzeroDist --output-on-failure``` in the ```/build``` directory.

The robot behavior can be tested by running the ```follow_2d``` executable. The robot should follow the nearest obstacle without spinning, as shown in the video below.
