# Drive Square
{: .no_toc }
Project 1 Checkpoint - WARNING: THIS MATERIAL IS UNRELEASED AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE!
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Instructions

In this checkpoint you will use iteration to drive the robot in a square. Complete the following:

- Implement drive square in ```p1_wall_follower/1_drive_square.cpp``` so that the robot performs the behavior specified below.

You'll need to use the [MBot Bridge API](https://hellorob.org/mbot/bridge-api) to send drive commands. 

- *Hint: Use the ```robot.drive(vx, vy, wz)``` function to move the robot.*

## Expected Behavior

The robot should drive in a square three times. Aim for a sidelength between 0.5 and 1 meters.

## Testing

There are no unit tests for this checkpoint.

The robot behavior can be tested by running the ```drive_square``` executable.
