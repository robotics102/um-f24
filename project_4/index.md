Project 4
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Teams

This project will be completed individually. You will not need a robot until the very end. At that point, we will assign two people per robot.

## Getting Your Code

To get your starter code download the files by clicking [here](https://robotics102.org/um-f24/assets/template_code/p4_notebooks_template.zip) and extracting them, or by running the commands below in your terminal. 

* Navigate to a directory that is not already a git repository using ```cd```. If running ```git status``` outputs ```fatal: ...``` you're not in a git repository.
* Download the files from the website ```wget https://robotics102.org/um-f24/assets/template_code/p4_notebooks_template.zip```.
* Unzip the files ```unzip p4_notebooks_template.zip```.
* Delete the zip archive ```rm p4_notebooks_template.zip```.

*Starter code for the robot portion coming soon*

## Setting Up Your Repository

You will want to complete these notebooks on [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by uploading them to your [Google Drive](drive.google.com). You won't need a GitHub repository for ths portion of the projects.
